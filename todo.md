# Technical Test: Node.js Developer with TypeScript, Fastify, Prisma, and Monorepo

## Task 1: Advanced Monorepo Setup (25 points) [Optional]

- [X] Set up a monorepo structure using a tool like Lerna or Yarn Workspaces.
- [ ] Consider creating separate packages for different concerns (e.g., API, services, utilities).

## Task 2: Advanced Server Setup (20 points)

- [X] Implement a Fastify application using TypeScript for enhanced type safety.
- [X] Organize the codebase to support scalability and maintainability.

## Task 3: Advanced Database Integration with Prisma and PostgreSQL (30 points)

### User Management (15 points)

- [X] Integrate Prisma for database access with a PostgreSQL database and define a User model.
- [X] Implement CRUD operations for user management (create, read, update, delete).
- [X] Include input validation and error handling for user-related operations.

### Relationships and Data Validation (15 points)

- [X] Extend the data model to include relationships between entities (e.g., users and posts).
- [X] Implement advanced data validation using Prisma's constraints.

## Task 4: Authentication and Authorization (20 points)

- [X] Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- [X] Create middleware for route authorization based on user roles and permissions.
- [X] Secure sensitive operations (e.g., user profile updates) behind authentication.

## Task 5: Advanced API Features (20 points)

### File Upload (10 points)

- [X] Implement an endpoint for users to upload profile pictures.
- [X] Store uploaded files securely and efficiently (consider using cloud storage if applicable).

### Real-time Notifications (10 points)

- [X] Implement a real-time notification system using WebSocket or a similar technology.
- [X] Notify users of relevant events (e.g., new messages, updates).

## Task 6: Testing and Documentation (15 points)

- [X] Write unit tests for critical functions and endpoints using a testing library (e.g., Jest).
- [X] Provide comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or Fastify Swagger.

## Task 7: Monorepo and Separate Packages (25 points) [Optional]

- [X] If you've chosen to set up a monorepo, ensure that the structure is well-organized.
- [ ] Create separate packages for different concerns (e.g., API, services, utilities).
- [ ] Demonstrate how changes in one package affect others.

## Adicional
 - [ ] Add prettier
 - [ ] Add eslint
 - [ ] Add husky
 - [ ] QA: Why I didn't use the fastify-jwt or fastify/auth

## Submission Guidelines

- Share the link to the Git repository containing your code.
- Provide a detailed README with instructions, architecture overview, and any additional information.
- Ensure that your API is deployed, and share the deployment link (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
