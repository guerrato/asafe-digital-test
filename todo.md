## Task 1: Advanced Monorepo Setup (25 points) [Optional]

- [x] Set up a monorepo structure using a tool like Lerna or Yarn Workspaces.
- [x] Consider creating separate packages for different concerns (e.g., API, services, utilities).

## Task 2: Advanced Server Setup (20 points)

- [x] Implement a Fastify application using TypeScript for enhanced type safety.
- [x] Organize the codebase to support scalability and maintainability.

## Task 3: Advanced Database Integration with Prisma and PostgreSQL (30 points)

### User Management (15 points)

- [x] Integrate Prisma for database access with a PostgreSQL database and define a User model.
- [x] Implement CRUD operations for user management (create, read, update, delete).
- [x] Include input validation and error handling for user-related operations.

### Relationships and Data Validation (15 points)

- [x] Extend the data model to include relationships between entities (e.g., users and posts).
- [x] Implement advanced data validation using Prisma's constraints.

## Task 4: Authentication and Authorization (20 points)

- [x] Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- [x] Create middleware for route authorization based on user roles and permissions.
- [x] Secure sensitive operations (e.g., user profile updates) behind authentication.

## Task 5: Advanced API Features (20 points)

### File Upload (10 points)

- [x] Implement an endpoint for users to upload profile pictures.

## Task 6: Testing and Documentation (15 points)

- [x] Write unit tests for critical functions and endpoints using a testing library (e.g., Jest).
- [x] Provide comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or Fastify Swagger.

## Task 7: Monorepo and Separate Packages (25 points) [Optional]

- [x] If you've chosen to set up a monorepo, ensure that the structure is well-organized.
